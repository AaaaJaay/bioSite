        <h5>Dance</h5>
        <p>One of her earliest goals was to dance on-pointe in ballet.  I think she was about 3 when she decided it would happen.  She has now been dancing on-pointe for three years.  While dance is one of her favorite hobbies, it is not something she will pursue for a career.</p>

        <h5>Plant-Based Diet</h5>
        <p>Three years ago, ShadowCat decided to be a vegetarian after a lot of contemplating.  The impact raising livestock has on the environment along with the living conditions of those animals was not worth it to her when she could get the nutrition and protein she needs from plant-based sources.  Currently her favorite restaurant is Modern Love.</p>

        <h5>Giving Back</h5>
        <p>ShadowCat has always been focus on giving back to the community.  Her first volunteer experience was making sandwiches at the Micha House.  She volunteered at the Henry Doorly Zoo as part of their summer program for 3 years.  Currently she spends 2 days a week at Midlands Humane Society socializing and taking care of their cats.</p>

        <h5>Future</h5>
        <p>She has always had a passion for science especially the idea of hacking DNA.  Her passion for science was originally inspired when she learned that scientists had grown a human ear on the back of a rat.  While 3-D printing will quickly replace this practice, she believes that there are more opportunities with DNA which can help improve peopleâ€™s lives.  ShadowCat is hoping to pursue a degree in Genetic Engineering.</p>
